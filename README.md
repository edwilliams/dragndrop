# drag n drop

## Context

The idea behind this tool is for designers to very quickly prototype an idea. Ideally on a call with developers.

each project can have multiple "screens"

each screen can have three things: images, clickable areas, various form inputs (starting with just textarea)

## Ideas

- screens can be clonable
- screens can be named

## Basic user journey

click new area button => new draggable area
click input button => new draggable input field
click new screen button: screen goes blank with Screen B title
right click area

---

start with block on screen
right click and select background
create new input field
