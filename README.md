# Drag 'n' Drop

## Context

The idea behind this tool is for designers to very quickly prototype an idea.

Ideally on a call with developers.

Each project can have multiple "screens"

Each screen can have a textarea or a button (more elements to follow)

The content of any form fields is arbitary

Each button click leads to the next screen
